## About Me
My name is **Hannah**, and I am a student at Williams College. I love to cook and spend time outdoors.

## About the Project
The title of my project is *Fuel efficiency and weight*. It is a plot about cars and their mileage per gallon. This project was completed as part of Kane's data science bootcamp.

### Goals
* In my project, I might like to explore abortion access and its importance.
  + Since the SCOTUS reversal of Roe v. Wade was so recent, it may be difficult to find accurate data.
* I also might like to explore environmental justice issues. Perhaps I would look into health outcomes in neighborhoods near Superfund sites.
